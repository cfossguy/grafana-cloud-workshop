This workshop is targeted to site reliability engineers that want to become 
Grafana literate with minimal effort. The labs should be completed
in sequence and can be used as handy references once you understand the 
key concepts.

## Grafana Dashboards
**User Story** - As an SRE, I want to build a new RED dashboard so that the application team has a customized view of 
key application and system metrics. 

**For every resource, monitor:**

1. Rate (the number of requests per second)
2. Errors (the number of those requests that are failing)
3. Duration (the amount of time those requests take)

### Key Concepts
* Panels 
* Queries
* Dashboard Settings
* Alerts

### Breakouts
[Breakout 1](./Breakout1.md): Build simple RED dashboard with [TestData DB](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/datasources/testdata/)
