This workshop is targeted to site reliability engineers that want to become 
Grafana literate with minimal effort. The labs should be completed

## Grafana Dashboards
**User Story** - As an SRE, I want to build a new RED dashboard so that the application team has a customized view of 
key application and system metrics. 

**For every resource, monitor:**

1. Rate (the number of requests per second)
2. Errors (the number of those requests that are failing)
3. Duration (the amount of time those requests take)

### Key Concepts
* Panels 
* Queries
* Dashboard Settings
* Alerts
